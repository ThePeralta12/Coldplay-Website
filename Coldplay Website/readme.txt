Name: Carl Ferdinand Peralta

Date of Completion: 17/04/18

Site Name: Coldplay 

Functional Description: To inform the public about Coldplay in General, form the band members, albums, songs, etc. My target audiences are young people with the passion of music

Version of Browser used: Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox
Functional Issue : Inability of the burger menu to function, the header in album page does take cover the whole top when screen is minimised.
 
possible solutions could be rewriting the css, removing any margins or padding around the header.

Any last minute changes: Changed the colour to green and centred the text of "Recent News". located in the index.html in <aside>.
I added CSS to the burger menu. (finally works)
