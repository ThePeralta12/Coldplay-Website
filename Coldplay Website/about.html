<p>Known as the lead singer of Coldplay, Chris Martin is band's most well-known member. He's the face of the band and yet the most humble also often insecure, Martin has a habbit of saying "Sorry and Thank you" to anyone associated with Coldplay and within shouting distance. "Thanks alot and for you have done and for you are doing for us". He claims that there are only 3 things that stay constant in his busy life: 1. His turbulet relationship with women that drags his songwriting, 2. The fear of dying young , 3. And a paranoid obsession of hear lost.</p>
